## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

### What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis in the SDLC is the compass that guides software through the complex terrain of the development, ensuring every steps align with your destination: a successful user-centric application. Requirement analysis is important because it helps us get rid of the costly mistake of misalignment of project and overspending.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Cost and time estimation:facilitate accurate esimation of project cost, resources and time 
- Scope definition: clearly define the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep
- Clarity and understanding: it helps in understanding what the stakeholder expect from the software reducing ambinguity

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering
- Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholder to gather detailed information about their needs and expectation
- Surveys/Quentionnaires: Distributing surveys to gather requirement from a larger audience
- Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and system to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation
- Brainstorming: conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirement
- Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirement

3. Requirement Documentation
- Requirement specification document: Creating detailed documents that list both functional and non-functional requirements
- User Stories: Writing users stories to describe functionalities from users perspectives
- Use Cases: creating use case diagrams to show interaction between users and the system


4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Requirement Priotization: Priotizing requirement base on their importance and impact on the project
- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirement in terms of technical, financial and time constraint
- Modeling: Creating models (e.g data flow diagrams, entity relational diagrams) to visualise and analyze requirement

5. Requirement Validation
- Review and approval: Reviewing th documented requirement with the stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness
- Acceptance criteria: defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards
- Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirement are addressed during development and testing
